# Gen-AI-using-Python: Attention and Transformer

Welcome to my personal journey through the fascinating world of **Attention Mechanisms** and **Transformer Models**, implemented using Python. This repository serves as a learning journal, where I explore key concepts, build mini-projects, and apply what I learn in real-world-style tasks relevant to **data science and generative AI**.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This project is part of my continuous learning path in **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**. The goal is to break down complex concepts in modern deep learning — especially Transformers — into understandable, hands-on code using Python and popular ML frameworks.

Topics covered include:

- 🔍 Basics of Attention Mechanisms
- 🧠 Self-Attention and Multi-Head Attention
- 📦 Transformer Architecture (Encoder & Decoder)
- 💡 Positional Encoding and Feed-Forward Layers
- 🧾 Implementing Transformer from Scratch (Step-by-step)
- 📚 Case Studies and Practical Examples (e.g., Text Generation, Translation)
